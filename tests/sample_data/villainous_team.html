    <h1>Villainous team</h1>

    <p>
      A villainous team (Japanese: 悪の組織 evil organization) is a group of antagonists with a goal in opposition to the player and other friendly characters. Each generation of the core series games features a villainous team as a major plot element.
    </p>

    <p>
      Notable teams include <a href="/wiki/Team_Rocket">Team Rocket</a> from Kanto, 
      <a href="/wiki/Team_Aqua">Team Aqua</a> and 
      <a href="/wiki/Team_Magma">Team Magma</a> from Hoenn, and 
      <a href="/wiki/Team_Galactic">Team Galactic</a> from Sinnoh.
    </p>

    <h2>List of Villainous Teams</h2>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Team Name</th>
          <th>Region</th>
          <th>Goal</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>Team Rocket</td><td>Kanto</td><td>Exploit Pokémon</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Team Aqua</td><td>Hoenn</td><td>Expand the sea</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Team Magma</td><td>Hoenn</td><td>Expand the land</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Team Galactic</td><td>Sinnoh</td><td>Create new world</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      These teams often attempt to capture legendary Pokémon to achieve their goals. 
      The player character typically battles team members throughout their journey 
      and ultimately confronts the team leader.
    </p>

    <p>
      Despite their villainous nature, some teams have members who question their 
      organization's methods. Many teams disband after their leader is defeated 
      by the player.
